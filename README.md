# Heart Disease Prediction: Unmasking the Silent Killer ❤️🔍

## Introduction

Welcome to our journey into the realm of heart disease prediction! In this adventure, we explored a dataset filled with clues about heart health to predict and prevent the silent but deadly enemy - heart disease.

## Data at a Glance 📊

### Data Overview

Our dataset consists of several essential attributes related to heart health:

- **age:** The age of the individuals.
- **sex:** Gender of the individuals (0 for Female, 1 for Male).
- **cp:** Type of chest pain experienced (0: Typical Angina, 1: Atypical Angina, 2: Non-anginal Pain, 3: Asymptomatic).
- **trtbps:** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- **chol:** Cholesterol levels (in mg/dl).
- **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 for True, 0 for False).
- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results (0: Normal, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
- **thalachh:** Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **exng:** Exercise-induced angina (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **slp:** Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0: Downsloping, 1: Flat, 2: Upsloping).
- **caa:** Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
- **thall:** Thallium stress test result (1,3: Normal; 2: Fixed Defect; 0: Reversible Defect).
- **output:** The target variable indicating the presence of heart disease (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

## Data Exploration and Analysis 🕵️‍♀️📈

### Unveiling Hidden Patterns

We embarked on a journey of data exploration, unraveling hidden patterns and relationships within the data. With the power of visualization and statistical analysis, we gained insights into the factors that influence heart disease.

## Model Building and Prediction 🤖🔮

### Crafting the Heart Guardian

We summoned a fellowship of noble models to predict heart disease:

- 🧙‍♂️ **Logistic Regression:** The wise sage of classification.
- 🌲 **Decision Trees:** Ancient and wise, with branches of knowledge reaching far and wide.
- 🧙‍♀️ **Random Forest:** An enchanted forest of wisdom and prediction.
### Training for Battle

Our models underwent rigorous training and were tested in countless simulations, honing their skills for the ultimate confrontation with heart disease.

## Evaluation and Conclusion 🛡️📊

### Measuring Success

We used the sacred tools of ROC and AUC curves to measure our models' battle-readiness, ensuring they stood as strong guardians against the forces of heart disease.

### Heart Disease Guardians

After our epic journey, we emerged victorious, armed with a powerful model capable of predicting and preventing heart disease. Our mission continues, as we remain vigilant guardians of heart health.

May your own quest be filled with discovery and triumph, and may you join the ranks of heart guardians, protecting the hearts of many. ❤️🔍
